# <div align="center"> Playing Audio on Click in JavaScript </div>

***

#### Welcome everyone to my GitHub! 
Here I'll list how to get started so you can implement some of the code and test it out yourself.

I describe my process for using key methods to store an audio file and playing sound, as well as resources to find a sound clip. Let's begin!
